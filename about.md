I'm a Solutions Engineer in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). I've been in the GIS 
industry since around 2003, starting out as a techinician, then moving up through analyst 
and developer roles. I routinely work on the following: ArcGIS Server 
installs and setups, database and geodatabase creation and setup, process automation 
with Python, programming in .NET, web application development with Esri's JavaScript 
API and Knockout.js, and process design and documentation (I _do love_ to write).
